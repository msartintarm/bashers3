/*RAID 0
*
 Blocks should be striped across disks, starting with the lowest numbered disk and increasing.
 Each disk gets a strip of blocks, which is one or more   blocks.
 For example, with 3 disks and strip size of 2,
 disk 0 gets blocks 0-1 and 6-7,
 disk 1 gets blocks 2-3 and 8-9, &
 disk 3 gets blocks 4-5 and 10-11.
